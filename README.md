# 🕷 Web Crawler Ethical (OSINT Automation)

A Python-based **multi-threaded web crawler** capable of deploying multiple “spiders” simultaneously to harvest, parse, and organize public web data.  
Built for ethical **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** gathering, penetration testing, and automation.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how automated crawling tools can be built to collect large amounts of publicly available data for:
- Threat intelligence gathering.
- Reconnaissance during penetration testing.
- Competitive research and monitoring.

**Why It Matters**  
OSINT is a critical phase in ethical hacking and threat hunting.  
Adversaries use web crawlers to:
- Map target infrastructure.
- Extract sensitive info from exposed sources.
- Identify weak points in web applications.

Defenders must understand these tools to detect suspicious crawling behavior and harden their systems against automated reconnaissance.
